## Overview

The LED Control project allows you to control an LED hardware using a Raspberry Pi. It provides a Python service for direct control of the LED, a web server for monitoring and controlling the LED through a web interface, and various utility scripts for deployment, installation, and testing.

## Hardware Setup

To set up the hardware for the LED control project, follow these steps:

1. Connect the LED hardware to the Raspberry Pi using appropriate wiring. Refer to the wiring guide specific to your LED hardware.

2. Ensure that the Raspberry Pi is powered on and connected to the network.

3. Make a note of the GPIO pins used for controlling the LED hardware. You will need this information during the software setup.

For detailed instructions and wiring guides, refer to the HARDWARE_SETUP.md file.

## Software Setup

### Development Environment

To set up the development environment for the LED control project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development machine.

2. Install Python 3 and ensure it is accessible from the command line.

3. Install Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) by following the installation instructions for your operating system. Verify the installations.

4. Install the necessary project dependencies.

### Project Dependencies

The LED control project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- RPi.GPIO (for Raspberry Pi GPIO control)
- Flask (for the web server)
- Node.js (for the web server)
- npm (for managing Node.js dependencies)

Please ensure that these dependencies are installed and up to date on your development machine and Raspberry Pi before proceeding.

## Usage

To use the LED control project, follow these steps:

1. Update the hardware configuration in the led_service.py file with the correct GPIO pin numbers for controlling the LED.

2. Start the LED Python service on the Raspberry Pi.

3. Start the web server on the Raspberry Pi.

4. Access the web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to the Raspberry Pi's IP address or hostname.

For more detailed instructions on how to use the LED control project, refer to the USER_GUIDE.md file.
